/**
 * @file
 * "Preview" theme implementation for the moderation note entity.
 *
 * The only reason this exists as a distinct template is so that in the future
 * we can have more control over how notes look when viewed when the
 * "View Notes" button is clicked.
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - attributes: HTML attributes for the containing element.
 * - text: The plain text of the note.
 *   Using the nl2br Twig filter is recommended as the text may contain "\n".
 * - quote: The text that was selected when creating this note.
 * - created: The timestamp when this note was created.
 * - created_pretty: The created time, formatted to be human-readable.
 * - updated: The timestamp when this note was updated.
 * - updated_pretty: The updated time, formatted to be human-readable.
 * - author_name: The display name of the author.
 * - author_link: A link to the author, as rendered by $user->toLink().
 * - author_username: The username of the author.
 * - author_picture: The author's picture as rendered by the compact view mode.
 * - parent: The note's parent, if one exists.
 * - moderated_entity_link: A link to the entity this note is related to.
 * - edit_button: A button for the in-line edit form.
 * - delete_button: A button for the in-line delete form.
 * - view_button: A button which will render the sidebar with the "full" note.
 *   This is only relevant for the "preview" view mode.
