04088fe2-e0af-4735-9161-97745fc871a4,Teaching Kids about Money,"<p>Parents look to provide their children with a strong educational foundation and&nbsp;often&nbsp;teach&nbsp;a variety of topics but when the subject of money&nbsp;comes up, its common to lose direction.</p><p>Many parents feel their own financial situations to be less than ideal, therefore they cannot be a subject matter expert. Others simply do not know where to star. Regardless, only a quarter of families admit to thoroughly educating their children on the topics of&nbsp;money management.</p><p>But teaching about fiscal responsibility does not have to be boring, problematic or a percieved waste of time. Parents can engage their kids in activities that will make a difference.</p><p>Give Access to Money</p><p>An easy way to teach&nbsp;young children about money is to let them play with&nbsp;some cash. Sit down nd pour out some loose change and&nbsp;different denominations of paper money. A short math lesson on how many pennies go into a dollar can lead into an opportunity to explain how money is used to buy food, clothes and even toys.</p><p><span>You Can Bank On It</span></p><p>Encourage opening accounts for older children at your bank and help them deposit some of their own money. Consider a debit card or checkbook for pre-teens and teenagers&nbsp;explaining these are forms of money that can come with benefits and risks. Encourage short-term savings in piggy banks and drop in a few extra pennies each month as interest. This positive reinforcement and&nbsp;shared experiences of your own desire to have done better in your&nbsp;younger years. These important lessons will &nbsp;help them when they are on their own - and that's not too far away!</p><p>Engaging your children in a conversation about money is an important activity. Never forget&nbsp;that you’re helping to lay a foundation for their&nbsp;financial future. No one is perfect, but these teachings will make all the difference&nbsp;for your children. Aside from that, these activities may remind you of your own shortcomings and help your financial situation to boot.</p>",child-article-icon.png,trike-hero.jpg,Life
719a353a-fcf1-434b-a21a-263002e4c8bd,Managing Risk,"<p>""With Great Risk Comes Great Reward"" It was a fact when Andrew Carnegie built the first bridge made of steel and it's often a true statement in many ways. However, in the investment world, there is not always a great reward waiting on the other side of the river.</p><p>Taking on risk with investments could result in higher returns, but you will also experience the downs of the investment market much more significantly. Is that something you'll be able to stomach?</p><p>We often think of investing as a balance between settling for a little less by ""playing it safe"" or taking risks with the hope of hitting the proverbial ""home run."" Its important to keep in mind that finance reflects reality, you can try to manage risk but you can't fully avoid it. So its best to make risk work in your favor.</p><p><span>Balancing Risk</span></p><p>There are a number of different types of risk. Market risk comes to mind. The chance that an investment's value will go up or down can affect your pocketbook. Another kind of risk is that you may not earn enough on investments to keep up with inflation. Finally, there is a chance that an investment will not grow enough to significantly push your long term goals over the line - think early retirement.</p><p>Finding the right balance is different for each individual. In the end, your profile will not be the same as the next guy, and even J.P. Morgan, who once controlled the entire banking industry couldn't&nbsp;control the market itself. What you can do is try to set the foundation for a solid, long-term plan for achieving financial goals. A financial professional can be a helpful guide in this ever-changing process that will potentially require you to pivot as the years go by.</p><p><span>Investing for the Long Term</span></p><p>Remain steadfast and stay on target when investing for the long-term. You and your family's future is dependent on this kind of investment. You won't be investing to ""get rich quick"" but instead buckling down and preparing for the long haul. As the prices of stocks and bonds fluctuate, remember that those with an investment plan that they stick to nearly always do better than those who jump into the market (and just as quickly jump out) with no plan at all. The market will fluctuate - keep that in mind and avoid risk by establishing a long-term plan and sticking to it.</p><p>Diversification is key to managing risk. By spreading money around one is able to manage risk though investments that are not directly related to each other. This means different kinds of investments: &nbsp;U.S. stocks, bonds and mutual funds are a good start. True diversification also means investing in international markets and other kinds of assets such as real estate or commodities. As you'll find, these investments may move in different directions asynchronously. As stocks go up and down, you'll find that diversity in investments helps mitigate some of the loss. Diversification isn't a foolproof tactic, but its proven to be effective for a great many investor.</p><p><span>Too Little? Too Much? Not Enough?</span></p><p>Taking too little risk can actually hurt more than it will help in some cases. An investor in their 20s that puts all of their retirement savings into conservative funds isn't at much risk of losing money. However, there is potentially money left on the table considering that they weren't earning enough back to keep up with inflation. When the time comes to retire later in life, they will find that they did not take enough risk when they were young and begin running out of money as a result.</p><p>Choose a strategy and stick to your guns. Manage your emotions just as you would your portfolio. Learn as much as you can about different types of investments and strategies. When starting out, read up on the basics like IRAs and 401(k)s. Those that are closer to retirement need to consider how to shift their investment mix and start converting assets into income. Remember: Life is what you make of it.</p>",risk-article-icon.png,overpass-hero.jpg,Disability
44784251-08df-4066-af05-5c2f5e999728,Working with a Financial Professional,"<p><strong><span>Why Go Alone?&nbsp;Working with a Financial Professional</span></strong></p><p>Looking to improve your financial status? &nbsp;If you're trying to save more now, invest in your future, or gain some financial legroom, the choices are limited.</p><p>You can do it yourself, navigating the complexities of investments and insurance on your own. You can ask a friend or family member (probably the one who has always been “good with money”). Or you can work with a Financial Professional, a trained professional you can rely on to provide specific advice for your unique situation. Here’s why working with a Financial Professional works so well.</p><p>The DIY (do it yourself) method works for some when it comes to navigating the complex world of investments and insurance. Some rely on friends or family members to help... some. Or you can choose to work with a professional. Someone who is trained that you can rely on, a Financial Professional will provide tailored advice for your situation. Here's why it works:</p><p><strong>Clearing the Fog of Misinformation</strong></p><p>If you've found this article, it means you've probably been searching on the internet looking for information. Not only that, but your mental environment is constantly challenged with television and internet ads, media pundits and so-called ""experts"" all talking about finances, budgeting, investments and so-on. The average person can become overwhelmed with this information overload.</p><p>The problem is that none of this information applies to every single situation. &nbsp;Every person is unique and we all have our own financial problems to deal with. You wouldn't use a hammer to drill a hole in a wall and you wouldn't want to rely on the advice of someone who doesn't understand your financial situation speaking in broad strokes.</p><p>A Financial Professional, like a lighthouse in the evening, will cut through the fog and&nbsp;provide guidance toward safety with regard to your&nbsp;finances and long-term goals.</p><p><strong><span>Who Knows You Best?</span></strong></p><p>You might think that going at it your own or relying on family will give you the best shot, but the truth is that a financial professional will get to know you and most importantly, objectively assess your situation free of any emotional baggage. Factors like age, health, job situation and family life all come into play. The things that keep you up nightly are every day business for a seasoned professional. You'll sleep easier knowing you have a personalized, cohesive strategy that's based on a holistic approach to managing debts, taxes, savings and investments.</p><p><strong><span>Leveraging Professional Experience</span></strong></p><p>Finding time to do ""every day"" tasks like mowing the lawn or doing laundry can be difficult for most people. Do you really have time to sit down and comprehensively make sound financial decisions based on research, market understanding and professional training? &nbsp;The word “professional” is and important one to remember. Just as you wouldn't replace your home's roof yourself (unless you're a professional roofer) you wouldn't want to trust your financial overhead to anyone but a pro (not even yourself).</p><p><strong><span>Looking Long Term</span></strong></p><p>Establishing a relationship with a Financial Professional is a long-term investment in itself. It requires trust, patience and understanding. This is your ""nest egg"" and it takes time to build such a thing. Having a partner is a massive advantage in this situation. He or she will consistently look at the ever-changing financial landscape and help you make the right decisions for the current situation while also managing risk.&nbsp;</p><p>Every relationship is different, and you should assume that you'll be working closely. Make time to meet at least once a year with your chosen Financial Professional to re-evaluate the landscape of things. What has changed? What goals need re-evaluating? Stay in touch via email or phone to keep on the right track.</p><p><strong><span>You Do Your Job and the Financial Professional Does Theirs</span></strong></p><p>Do you have a degree in finance or economics? Do you have any professional certifications or accreditations? Do you own a business card with your name followed by the likes of ""CFP"" or ""CIIA""? If the answer is no, then remember this: &nbsp;that's totally okay.</p><p>Most people will answer ""No"" to those questions. However, we can all work around this by establishing a working relationship with a Financial Professional. Leave the heavy lifting to the real experts who understand your personal situation. Trust that your financial and family needs will be taken care of by someone who does this kind of thing for a living.</p>",professional-article-icon.png,our-story.jpg,Home
