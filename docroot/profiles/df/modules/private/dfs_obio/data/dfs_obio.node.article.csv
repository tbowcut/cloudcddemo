cdb4e570-ff8b-4085-91e9-ae50df32ab68,3 Office Design Trends Every Founder Must Know,Design trends that align your company for success,"<p>As a startup founder, one of your main responsibilities is to ensure your team performs at maximum efficiency. We believe the cornerstone of true workplace efficiency is in the design of your workplace.</p><p>Like everything, the design of the workplace varies over time. As trends evolve, so must your office—or you risk harming your employee efficiency.</p><p>Let’s look at three major office design trends and how they impact your team’s performance.</p><drupal-entity data-align='center' data-embed-button='media_browser' data-entity-embed-display='view_mode:media.embedded' data-entity-type='media' data-entity-uuid='63213c8c-6ec0-4c07-a396-bcf7898b8fe8'></drupal-entity><h2>1. Privacy in an Open-Office World</h2><p>For decades, the cubicle dominated office design, but at the end of the 90s, a new trend emerged: the open office. Cubicle farms fell, giving rise to workstations without walls or barriers.</p><p>Open offices promised more collaboration and creativity, and for more than a decade, innovation thrived. Yet over the last few years, employee dissatisfaction has grown. More than 90% of workers* around the world cite a lack of privacy as a major source of workplace gloom. When employers took away the walled cubicle, they also, it seems, took away their employees’ privacy.</p><p>Today’s office must allow for moments of privacy throughout the day. As you design your new office, consider small stalls in which a two- or four-person tables are set. This will allow for more intimate collaboration or opportunities for single employees to take a break from their colleagues and focus on their own assignments.</p><p>Get Inspired: <a href=""/product/downtown-collection"">Explore the Downtown Style Collection &gt;&gt;</a></p><drupal-entity data-align='center' data-embed-button='media_browser' data-entity-embed-display='view_mode:media.embedded' data-entity-type='media' data-entity-uuid='1296c7ac-0139-4638-85d5-f938e00472fd'></drupal-entity><h2>2. Integrated Technology</h2><p>As more Millennials take over the workforce (with Generation Z right behind them), simple technological integrations will become essential to any modern office design. Today’s workforce is not tied down to a desktop computer or phone—the cords have been cut.</p><p>If you’re looking to maximize the efficiency of your tech-savvy employees, consider furniture and designs that integrate technology from the ground up. Wireless charging stations will mitigate the forgotten charger, and new LiFi technology will soon be integrated throughout the office, giving employees the freedom to spread out and stay connected.</p><p>Get Inspired: <a href=""/product/technology-collection"">Explore the Tech Style Collection &gt;&gt;</a></p><drupal-entity data-align='center' data-embed-button='media_browser' data-entity-embed-display='view_mode:media.embedded' data-entity-type='media' data-entity-uuid='b0d45e22-713d-48a6-9720-c28b8f612324'></drupal-entity><h2>3. Well-Being in the Workplace</h2><p>We all know wellness programs have become the staple of any employee benefits package, but well-being is more than ensuring your employees stay healthy outside of work. A growing trend is to maximize your employees’ health while at work.</p><p>The WELL Building Standard™ is a certification-focused initiative that Obio subscribes to and one that promotes well-being through a number of factors.</p><p>Sit-stand tables improve the health and mind of employees (and keep them from being couch potatoes). LEED®-certified products also ensure you’re buying only eco-friendly materials, which lead to a more positive company culture.</p><p>Get Inspired: <a href=""/product/eco-friendly-collection"">Explore the Eco-friendly Style Collection &gt;&gt;</a></p><p>Have more to add to the story?

005a8c97-bb04-40e6-95f0-67e75999e2c5,Cleaning Up Your Carbon Footprint at Work,4 Tips for making a Carbon-neutral office,"<p>The average U.S. employee uses more than 10,000 sheets of copy paper each year—<a href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/blog/morning_roundup/2014/05/pulp-fiction-how-many-trees-does-it-take-to-make.html"" target=""_blank"">roughly equal</a> to 1.2 trees. With so much change happening to our world’s climate and environment, we all must do what we can to reduce the negative impact we have on the planet.</p><p>But there’s more we can do than just save paper. Check out our four tips for cleaning up your carbon footprint at work.</p><h3>1. Reduce Electricity Use</h3><p>At the end of every work day, turn off all electronics—especially computers. The “standby” or “sleep” settings still consume plenty of wasteful electricity.</p><p>Set your computers and other electronics to their best possible efficiency settings. For example, most monitors can shut themselves off after a period of time, say 15 minutes, of idleness.</p><p>Turn off the lights in conferences room or kitchens when not in use. Go a step further and install motion-detecting dimmer switches to ensure you never forget.</p><h3>2. Go Digital, but If You Must Use Paper…</h3><p>It may seem obvious in 2017, but it’s worth repeating: Go digital. With so many services available online and in the cloud, most businesses have little reason for needing anything in print. Digital storage also makes business travel and moving offices a breeze.</p><p>But if you must use paper…please purchase recycled paper and be diligent about what you print and how. Look for printers capable of double-sided printing and purchase refillable ink cartridges.</p><p>A simple solution we use at Obio (for the rare times when we need to print) is to discard any printed paper that’s no longer needed into a “whoops” bin. Once we have enough “whoops” paper, we bind them into notebooks and use the empty sides for notetaking.</p><p>One last idea: If you ship a lot, use your shredded paper as packing material.</p><h3>3. Work from Home</h3><p>The best advice we can offer to clean your carbon footprint at work is to redesign your office space with eco-friendly designs. Our Eco-friendly Style Collection, for example, offers office furniture made from recycled materials. When purchasing, look for LEED® Certifications on products.</p><p>You can also improve your light quality with LED desk lamps and by allowing as much natural light as possible through your office windows (and thus reducing the need to use electric lights at all).</p><p><a href=""/product/eco-friendly-collection"">Get Inspired: Explore the Eco-friendly Style Collection >></a></p>",eco-blog.jpg,eco,0,1481061692
63cfeb37-8bce-4883-9dfc-a9c72477173f,How to Recruit and Retain Employees with the Perfect Office Design,The three key components to using your office as a recruitment tool,"<p>As the HR recruiter for your company, you know how strong benefits packages, company profitability, and proven career growth can all work wonders to attract the top candidates in your industry. And once you onboard them, you get how company culture, work-life balance, and predictable bonuses can keep them loyal. But when you consider everything that goes into recruitment and retention, how often do you think of your office's design?</p><p>The layout and look of your office should be one of the most crucial tenets of your recruitment and retention strategy. According to Millennial Impact's 2015 report, your office's environment is the fourth most important factor millennials consider when choosing a job.</p><p>How can you design your office to improve your recruitment and retention rates? We recommend designing for <strong>collaboration</strong>, <strong>flexibility and accessibility</strong>, and <strong>enlightenment</strong>. </p><h3>Collaboration</h3><p>With today's technology, people have a choice whether to work from home or at the office. For those who prefer the latter, collaboration is the true selling point. People want to work with people—to learn from them and to make great things together. Your office's design, therefore, should facilitate that need to better recruit and retain employees.</p><p>Large workstations, conference tables, and breakout rooms will foster this collaboration, but if you're looking for new ideas, consider borrowing from higher education institutions. Your new millennial employees just spent at least four years collaborating in creative, out-of-the-box ways. Take a trip to your local university and find inspiration.</p><p><a href=""/product/casual-collection"">Get Inspired: Explore Our Casual Style Collection >></a></p><h3>Flexibility & Accessibility</h3><p>All employees want the freedom to choose how to perform their jobs. No one wants to be told to sit at a small cubicle and bang on a keyboard eight hours a day, five days a week. To provide the flexibility your employees deserve, bring in workstations on wheels. Get desks that allow for sit-stand customizations and that come with retractable privacy walls for employees who need quiet during ""crunch time."" You should also consider providing employees access to office light levels, temperature control, and ventilation.</p><p>You also need to consider accessibility when designing your office. Whether it's following ADA laws for those with disabilities or providing support for multi-generational offices, consider the nuances and needs of your employees' accessibility.</p><h3>Enlightenment</h3><p>Ever worked in a window-less office? Felt the burning buzz of bright white fluorescent lights bearing down on you? If you're feeling that tingle of stress just reading these words, then you shouldn't have any trouble understanding the importance of natural light in the office.</p><p>Natural light is proven to produce more effective and productive employees. Moreover, naturally lit offices just look good—don't forget how important the first impression is to candidates during their interview.</p><p>Even if you don't have floor-to-ceiling windows, you can still manage to bring as much natural light into the office as possible. Ditch the blinds—or have them always drawn up by default. Clean up the clutter on the sills. You may even want to consider tearing down any interior walls and replacing them with glazed partitions.</p><h3>Conclusion: Design Competitively</h3><p>At every stage of the recruitment process, you're competing with other employers for the best candidates. Not every selling point is within your control (who can predict economic market forces with accuracy?). Nevertheless, your office is 100% within your power, and you can ensure that when a candidate or employee steps through the door, your design blows the competition away.</p><p><a href=""/shop/office"">Get Inspired: Explore Our Style Collections Today >></a></p>",recruitment-meeting.jpg,recruitment,1,1481061691
3f2d7116-00e9-44da-abb0-c27bbdb752c6,3 Reasons to Never Get Complacent about Your Office's Design,Inspire creativitiy and attract new talent,"<p>Designing an office is a lot like buying a new iPhone. In the beginning, you can’t take your eyes off it, you love exploring the details, and you love how well it’s put together. But just like an iPhone, after a few years, it’s time for an upgrade.</p><p>New trends emerge, while old trends slip away into the past. The office you designed a year ago may not be as modern as it once was. That’s why we created our Ambiance Packages, a subscription-based service from Obio that never lets your office design fall out of fashion.</p><p>Still not convinced? Here are three compelling reasons why you should never get complacent about your office’s design. </p><h3>1. Your Company’s Grown</h3><p>When you founded the company, you had a handful of loyal employees spread out across desks and tables, working all hours of the day to build a successful new startup. Because of that determination, you’ve found success and now need more hard workers to keep the momentum churning.</p><p>All that space has shrunk as the bodies who fill it have multiplied. If this scenario sounds too familiar, you must consider updating your office layout and design.</p><p>New workstations allow for more bodies without cramming everyone in like sardines. Trade out those massive executive desks for something more streamlined that doesn’t compromise ergonomics.</p><h3>2. Your Furnishings Are Outdated</h3><p>That egg chair you have in the corner that no one sits in anymore? There’s a reason for that. Fads come and go, and office design is not impervious.</p><p>But we’re not just talking about desks and chairs. Remember technology plays an integral role in your office’s look and feel. For Obio customers who’ve purchased the <a href=""/product/technology-collection"">Tech Style Collection</a>, they have the option of adding on Ambiance Packages that include regular hardware maintenance and free software upgrades. (Find out more here.)</p></h3>3. Your Competitors’ Offices Are Mirror Images</h3><p>Visited your competitors’ offices lately? Look a little familiar? Maybe it’s time to consider adding “office design” to your SWOT analysis.</p><p>As trends become mainstream, more and more businesses begin to steal from one another until every office you enter looks like an extension of the previous one.</p><p>Our Ambiance Packages include custom options for our customers. Our Ambiance Specialists work directly with our customers to design and deliver custom furnishings, elements, or artwork. As a result, your office truly is unique.</p><p><a href=""/shop/office"">Get Inspired: Learn more about our Ambiance Packages >></a></p><p><em>Have more to add to the story?

6e67a931-4c13-4c0a-bcea-d5cb1cda64b2,Meet the Young Designer Who's Changing the Industry,Bringing modular design to the modern world,"<p>In the world of interior design it’s easy to follow whatever trends are in vogue, but very few actual lead the pack with creative and original work. Usually these leaders have decades of industry experience, but on a rare occasion the design world sees a young trendsetter come out of, seemingly, nowhere.</p><p>This year that designer has without a doubt been Frederick Chui, a 25 year old working out of Los Angeles for Laviini, a small firm focused on smart, modular office furniture. Chui has only been working professionally for three years, but has been independently designing furniture since the age of 16.</p><p>The work Chui is doing at Laviini is focused on modular furniture, which are pieces that can be easily stored or repurposed for a variety of uses. His first work at the firm, the Harmaa, is a large table that includes four chairs folded into its top frieze. The chairs are also modular, and have backs that can fold down into a small end table.</p><p>Chui’s work has been recognized in the professional world in the form of an International Interior Innovation Award, and interviews in magazines like Sit Up Straight and Modern Matte. Now as a part of our partnership with Laviini, Obio is proud to bring you the latest Chui designs in our collections and products.</p><p>If you’re interested in modular designs, be sure to check our Minimalist Collection, which includes the Harmaa and similar products that can adapt to a workspace of any kind and size. For more Laviini products, make sure to take a look into individual items or contact us to see if we can add modular furniture onto your existing Ambiance Package.</p>",designer-q-a.jpg,designer q&a,0,1481061690
b9fe7602-4d3a-4ebb-b5ce-aeca22dd05f2,Taking Cues from Restaurant Design for Your Own Home or Office,"The newest trends, hot and fresh out the kitchen","<p>The world of restaurant design is as fast-paced and nuanced as the industry itself, which has led home and office design to watch and wait as new trends are cooked up in the food world. We’ve recognized this at Obio, and have compiled a list of our favorite design cues for our customers and readers.</p><h3>Make Your Faults Features</h3><p>One of the best trends to blow up this year was exposing, well, everything. While the last decade has seen a boom in brick walls and unfinished wood tables, we’re now seeing that every part of a space that looks good raw, should be presented raw. From lightly-treated concrete floors to nail-strewn reclaimed wood, leaving your space open to interpretation is sometimes better than trying to cover up your faults. If you office or home is in a historic location, or the previous tenants left some interesting talking points behind, you may want to put down the sledgehammer and take another look.</p><h3>Up, Up, and Away</h3><p>Following the trend of working with your space, restaurants have started to look upward for their design. If you’re lucky enough to move into a building with high ceilings, there are many options for how you address that empty space. An interesting approach is to implement a unique paneling on the ceiling, often something structural like papercraft, loose fabric, or a large geometric wood pattern. By making the ceiling a part of your space, and not just a place where your lights are hung, you bring your guests eyes upwards towards areas that would otherwise go unnoticed. If you want to inspire creative thinking in your family or staff, this is a great way to start.</p><h3>The Lounge is Back</h3><p>Dark lighting, plush leather seating, and dark wood paneling are all back in style as restaurants begin to harken back to the golden age of mid-century lounge design. Implementing a lounge style in your office or home is a great way to fight back against the modernist wave of minimalist design, throwing your guests into the past while maintaining a level of class.</p>",kitchen.jpg,kitchen,0,1481061695
2362bf1f-095d-467a-93b9-b4d6f6d414c9,You can have a Space that Fosters Creativity and Collaboration,Simple solutions for creative thinking,"<p>It’s easy to get caught up in design trends that push a seemingly cold, minimal style into spaces that are supposed to feel warm and welcoming. While there are benefits to having a modern looking office, you don’t have to only plan purely functional spaces for your employees.</p><p>As a way to break aware from a corporate environment and prevent creative stifling, many startups have begun to implement experimental spaces that their staff can visit to let off steam and get into a different mindset. These sort of spaces, which can take the form of ball pits, swing sets, and game rooms, enable employees to flourish creatively and meet in a context that would be impossible in a traditional office.</p><p>If you’re planning to redesign your space, or you’re starting from scratch, consider some of the following starter options for promoting an open-minded workplace:</p><p><strong>Ball Pit Rooms</strong> - While slightly impractical, simply retrofitting one of your conference rooms into a ball pit can do wonders for office morale. It may get a bit loud over the phone, but for in-person meetings this is a fun and easy way to get started.</p><p><strong>Game Rooms</strong> - Whether it’s foosball or table tennis, reserving a space for play is an important part of fostering creativity. Employees can choose to take meetings over a game, but should also know that taking a break without thinking of work is totally acceptable, and supported.</p><p><strong>White Board Walls</strong> - An affordable option for any office is to buy a dry-erase gloss and apply it to a regular white wall. This lets your staff express themselves in any room, whether they’re drawing a picture or planning a project.</p><p>For larger re-designs and bigger ambitious, Obio offers many individual products and collections that can help jumpstart your creative space.</p>",people-coffee-tea-meeting.jpg,office design,0,1481061696
fc797ea9-2269-40ad-85e0-da7d82e001ba,The Importance of Accessorizing Your Desk Properly,Refresh your work space,"<p>When thinking about your office’s design, it’s easy to forget the place where your employees are going to spend the majority of their time: their desk. It’s common for this area to be overlooked, especially in open office settings. While the traditional office tends to keep their cubicles homogenous, we’ve found that customized employee workspaces can increase attendance and morale.</p><p>In addition to providing you with the right furniture for your office, we can also help you diversify your desks with a wide selection of accessories. Even simple modifications to your office’s style can make employees feel unique and valued, which is an important part of maintaining an office culture that motivates your staff.</p><p>A perspective that, surprisingly, is often not considered when purchasing desk accessories is that of your own employees. Before you jump into anything, reach out to your staff and see what they feel comfortable with. For example, some employees may be passionate about house plants, but their co-workers could have sensitive allergies that prevent them from enjoying office greenery. Gather feedback early on in the process, and make sure that the decisions you make are for the betterment of the entire office.</p><p>How your office looks and feels to staff and visitors is an important extension of your company’s image. Any effort that goes into accessorizing work spaces is going to see positive returns, whether from employees who need that extra push to get excited about coming into work, or from visitors who are getting a first impression of your business.</p><p>Of course it’s easy to have your accessorized desks get stale over time. One way to prevent this is to bring in new items as a part of our Ambiance Packages. In addition to an initial setup, our design experts will visit your office and swap out your old decor with our latest collections on a monthly or yearly basis. We’ve seen a lot of success in this area, and believe that keeping a space vibrant and fresh is vital to business success.</p>",desk-setup-blog.jpg,office design,0,1481061697
bdfb73e8-d4da-4667-ab50-db1543ba7bf2,"Renovation Must Haves from Our Resident Designer, Rachel Liosa","Design for people, not spaces","<p>Renovating an office space can be a daunting task, whether you’re completely changing your floor plan or just swapping out a few desks. Working for Obio as an interior designer, I’ve realized that most renovations run into the same design problems, and wanted to share some areas that are often overlooked when starting an office redesign.</p><h3>Plan to Expand</h3><p>By far the biggest oversight I see when assisting with renovation is that the proposed floor plan has no empty space - every square foot is a desk, meeting room, or shared work space. Meticulously filling every corner of your floor plan is setting you up to fail, which most offices realize as soon as they grow out of their existing space. Instead of playing Tetris with your renovation, give yourself some room to breathe. These empty areas in your office can be used for events, expansion, or for easily portable furniture.</p><h3>Privacy in an Open Space</h3><p>One of the largest trends in renovation is the open floor plan, which aims to remove barriers (cubicle walls) between desks and increase collaboration between employees. This design methodology is great in theory, but for some roles the interruptions and distractions of the work place can be detrimental to productivity. If you’re going to implement an open floor plan, don’t forget to include private spaces for your employees. Whether these are traditional meeting rooms, or simply single-occupancy offices, having a quiet place to work is vital to a happy workplace.</p><h3>Over Designed, Under Utilized</h3><p>Following more modern trends, renovations will often include shared work spaces, which provide areas for employees to relax, work, or meet in. If you plan to include one or more shared work spaces, take the time to talk to your staff first to see what they would actually use. While this may seem obvious, designers will often follow the crowd and plan spaces that no one actually needed in the first place. If your office is happy to work at their desks, it may be a better use of your budget to improve break rooms and kitchens than to create a new shared space.</p><p>In general, the best advice I have is to spend more time understanding the needs of your office than meticulously designing your space. If you can come up with a workplace that looks and feels right for your employees, you’ve delivered a successful renovation. Good luck!</p>",designer.jpg,designer q&a,0,1481061689
ab79849a-d078-4a11-8f11-f2f5579ee3da,Let’s Get to the Bottom of Built-Ins: Read the Poll,Making the most out of your space,"<p>After conducting a poll of our customers, we’ve found that while most like the concept of using built-ins in their office space, they haven’t seen solutions available that fit their needs. This was surprising to us, as in the past we haven’t included built-ins into our packages or products. Obviously a trend is growing in interior design, and we’re going all in.</p><p>Traditionally in a modern office setting, you would only see built-ins if they were originally included with the space, or in the form of something like a wall-sized media cabinet. However, as more offices begin to adopt a more vintage look, they’re looking back to classic mid-century design and re-adopting the built-in as a part of their space.</p><p>One great way that built-ins can be used in an office is to facilitate extra storage space, where building a full-size closet would be too costly or permanent. Built-ins have a low profile, and can frame already-existing furniture like couches and benches with shelves and cabinets. Beyond the storage, built-ins have always served a display purpose, and are an effective method for showing off your company’s achievements, whether they come in the form of awards or media displays.</p><p>As open floor plans become increasingly common, built-ins could play a new role in how interior designers think about spaces. Based on this recent customer feedback, we’re planning a new line of modular built-in solutions that can expand the storage and display capacity of any space, with no construction and little investment. Following our history of delivering dynamic, adaptive design for our clients, we’re planning to incorporate built-ins into our Ambiance Packages, which we hope will lead to more exciting innovations.</p><p>If you’re an Obio customer or avid reader of our blog and missed the poll, please reach out to us and let us know what you think.</p>",collection-vintage-4.jpg,office design,0,1481061688
1884b585-42e9-4999-ad00-0ed081eb99fa,The Importance of Having Comfortable Lobby Furniture,"In a lobby, clients should feel at home","<p>For visitors, the first impression of your company, office, and culture is your lobby. When designing this space people usually focus on the front desk, media displays, and sign, but often overlook the furniture.</p><p>Ideally you wouldn’t be keeping your clients waiting for long, but while they’re in your lobby they should feel relaxed and accommodated. Having something modern and rigid isn’t going to impress anyone when they’re sitting down, so consider investing in the comfort of your guests by budgeting the best lobby furniture possible.</p><p>At Obio we try to balance form and fashion by working with vendors who design for people - not pictures. This means that every piece of furniture we sell has been vetted by both external and internal design teams, and our many happy customers that stress test our products. It’s easy to get caught up in the competitive, modernist world of design and forget that the most important function of a chair is still sitting, not viewing.</p><p>With all this in mind, we urge every client we work with to create a lobby that looks professional but feels personal. Something that your clients don’t mind being in for awhile, and maybe even enjoy waiting in. As a part of this recommendation, we also ask that all of our customers test out our furniture when we send it, and gladly accept feedback if our products don’t make people feel comfortable and relaxed.</p><p>In addition to our commitment to your lobby’s initial comfort and design, our Ambiance Packages can also enable you to have a fresh design on a monthly or yearly basis. Having a new look can make your lobby something people want to visit, and a place that your employees are excited to walk through each day.
