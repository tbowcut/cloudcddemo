The festival featured performances from AU students and faculty, as well as resident composers from around the world.</p><p>The festival is just one component of the Acquia U New Music Initiative (AUNMI), a diverse array of programs intended to position the AU School of Music as a leading center in the areas of composition and new music.

6c0161a1-2852-48d1-8ab9-2fbf30bcd24f,Don't be afraid to get creative: Your Personal Essay Enables Us to See You!,Advice for writing a memorable personal essay,"<p>By the time this article reaches you, I will have gone through four opening statements, discarded three complete drafts, reworked two outlines, and ruminated on its purpose for one sleepless night.</p><p>No amount of practice or preparation will alter the long and occasionally haphazard process of drafting and revision that my work will undergo, and in fact experience has only lengthened and complicated the system by which I miraculously produce each article.</p><p>Each day that I sit down to write I experience the same vague hesitation, unsure what to ask of this new document - and what it will ask of me.</p><p>College essays only accentuate this uncertainty, and the reason is simple: these essays are blank slates handed to us at a time when everything else around us - school, home, friends, our own identities - is suddenly a blank slate, too. The good news is that personal statements are not as paradoxical as they appear to be.</p><p>If these essays are approached as a welcome respite from the hailstorm of academic and personal pressures, and as an opportunity to be alone with and learn a little more about ourselves, then we are already halfway through the hardest part: getting started.</p><p>Here are a few strategies to help you do everything from brainstorming to drafting and editing an outstanding college essay.</p><p>Starting a draft and maintaining momentum are two of the most difficult aspects of writing any essay, personal or otherwise, because it can be easy to fall into &ldquo;should&rdquo; thinking (I should say this, I should have done that) and to focus more on what you think colleges want to hear than demonstrating your own unique qualities and perspectives.</p><p>The college essay is very a personal document, and without some internal investment the writing will begin to feel like a chore, and that sense of drudgery will show through in your writing.</p><p>There are many ways to bring life to your essays, however, especially if you are used to talking about yourself only in academic terms:</p><ol><li><p>Change your perspective. Can you use this personal statement as an opportunity for some alone-time, to put away your other responsibilities for a little while and appreciate devoting yourself to a single task? Can you view this not as another opportunity to mess up but as an occasion to fill in or make up for any other part of the application you are uncertain about?</p></li><li><p>Flex your critical thinking muscles. Personal statements are an occasion to demonstrate an ability to identify issues, pose good questions, and solve problems. To this end, these essays can be an important place to show social awareness and a genuine interest and engagement in world affairs. Whether you have kept up with the news on teacher wages or have lunchtime discussions with friends about public policy, we want to hear what you think and why. And note: application essays are not glorified resumes: you do not need to trek around the world to have informed opinions about global affairs. Read the news, look a little closer at your own neighborhood, and try questioning the status quo.</p></li><li><p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to get creative! The application essay is very much like a short story, where you just happen to play both author and main character. If you find yourself at a loss for ideas, pick a real setting from your life, place yourself in it, and see where the writing takes you. Often, it is in the most mundane places that we learn something about ourselves. What are you like at the breakfast table? What do you think about when you&rsquo;re waiting in line? How do you feel during those few seconds that you unlock your locker at the end of the day? You should be analytical and your story should have a point, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t be descriptive, too! Creative innovation is another great way to demonstrate your critical thinking skills for your readers.</p></li><li><p>Be yourself. Obvious perhaps, but also deceptively difficult to accomplish without some forethought. Application essays are one of the rare platforms whereon you can and should display talents that are not typically valued by the educational system. Are you excellent at tying knots? Are you a champion of anagrams? Are you exceptionally compassionate or display calm under pressure? Start a list and select a few qualities that you are especially proud of to explore, and maybe you will learn something new about yourself.</p> </li></ol><p>The most important thing to keep in mind is that writing your college application essays will require a lot of work, but they will also be a rewarding and affirming undertaking.</p><p>So keep calm, keep focused, and have fun!</p>",journal-writing.jpg,"prospective students",0,1481061688
5ffbdf5f-e547-4395-9f7f-f5d352e89b89,Acquia U Courts Western Michigan Football's PJ Fleck,An Open Letter to PJ Fleck,"<p>Dear Coach Fleck,</p><p>Congratulations on the success of your team&rsquo;s season this year. I wish them the best during the Cotton Bowl. More than wins and losses though, I applaud the way they conduct themselves, on and off the field. I appreciate their commitment to your vision. The buy-in from your athletes, Western Michigan&rsquo;s administration, and the community in general is remarkable.</p><p>As I&rsquo;m sure you know, your name has been raised many times over the past few days as someone who could fill Acquia University&rsquo;s head coaching vacancy. Much of this is founded on the success and buy-in shown this season. However, there have also been some who say you lack sufficient experience and the East Coast recruiting ties necessary to be a head coach in the Big East.</p><p>In my mind, this is not unlike another leader who, with little experience, led a disjointed group of teammates to perhaps the biggest upset in history. George Washington. To clarify, I hope you&rsquo;ll indulge me in a brief Big East history lesson from Acquia U&rsquo;s perspective.</p><p>Like the British monarchy before them, the Harvard Huskies make claims of being football royalty; complete with flaunted crowns on their jerseys. As our arch-rivals, it has been a bitter pill to see them succeed, while we struggle even to be competitive this year.</p><p>After decades of sporting oppression at their hands, our Lexington came at the hands and feet of one Mark Wheaton. The Pick heard &lsquo;round the world changed the trajectory of our football program forever. Since that time, Acquia U has become a household name, known &ndash; like their revolutionary counterparts &ndash; as innovators; rebels who bucked the drab conventions of traditional football. Where the tea party filled Boston Harbor and left the British dismayed, we filled the scoreboard with touchdowns and left our opponents gasping for air. We fought for a national title twice this decade, and for a dozen years, we thumbed our noses at the Huskies.</p><p>However, this season we stumbled. Many streaks were broken. Among them, 110-game home sellouts, 82 consecutive games with a passing touchdown, 22 seasons scoring a defensive touchdown, 10 seasons leading the Big East in rushing, eight seasons without losing consecutive games, 11 winning seasons, 11 seasons with a bowl appearance, nine seasons with a 1,000-yard rusher, and nine consecutive years being ranked in the final AP top 25. But amidst our many losses on the gridiron battlefield, we lost something much more vital: our identity and our vision.</p><p>Indeed, these are the times that try men&rsquo;s souls. The bitter cold of loss stings through our multi-colored uniforms. Our rivals are thriving, while our brand is tarnished. Other schools have adopted our innovations, while we list aimlessly into the mediocre. Our future recruits are deserting, and our current student athletes are unsure of the future. Make no mistake, Acquia University has talent. Our noses are bloodied, but our hearts beat strong. Our sacred honor remains intact. The administration and community want to succeed. We simply need someone to stand at our head and provide a call to arms.</p><p>You may or may not have all the recruiting ties and experience other coaches have. But like our Founding Father, I expect you would surround yourself with the best people to support and balance your strengths and weaknesses. If it&#39;s true that you prefer to coach your team in the Cotton Bowl, I can respect that. Though I also see the value in trusting the team of coaches and players to succeed through the principles you have instilled within them.</p><p>Coach, it&rsquo;s almost Christmas Eve. The royal Huskies and the other Hessians of the Big East have amassed on the far side of the icy river. AU needs a revolution. AU needs a coach who can Row. The. Boat.</p>",washington-delaware.jpg,fans,0,1481061688
1e5bd94b-dae7-4711-bd4e-d89b160b4b8c,Student Experience: Finals Week,Putting My Best Foot Forward,"<p>Personally, I feel the best way to begin an injury story is with the following lines:</p><p>&ldquo;The fight left me with several flesh wounds, twenty-seven stitches and a body cast, but you should see the other guy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll never know if the grizzly bear survived, but the deep gashes occupying my leg will always be a reminder of that night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;After the crash, I found myself crawling through the Gobi Desert for six hours, carrying nothing but a sack of yams on my back.&rdquo;</p><p>These phrases each encompass heroic qualities, all while adding a little mystery to the table. My injury story, however, could not be any more different. I can set the scene of my accident for you in a few words. Where? AU Stadium. Why? Pick-up soccer game. When? December 5. How? Tripped over ball. And just like that, I am now hobbling on crutches with a broken tibia and torn ligaments attempting to navigate my way through finals week.</p><p>Injuries are always a challenge, but college has really presented some unusual situations for me. If there is anything this experience has taught me, it is that there is always someone willing to reach out a hand to help. Also, never get a dorm on the third floor if you are accident prone. Here are some tips for anyone who may be sharing a similar experience:</p><p>Problem: I did not anticipate a snow storm striking this early in the Boston area. Crutches will never trump snow or ice. Never. Solution: Call campus safety! They will drive you anywhere on campus with their golf carts. If you ask nicely, they might even do some donuts in the parking lot.</p><p>Problem: Requiring five tons of ice to &ldquo;de-puff&rdquo; my foot. My foot closely resembles an overfilled balloon animal accented with colorful bruising. Solution: Rather than sending friends to Trader Joe&rsquo;s for more ice, just go to the cafeteria. The staff is chill (see what I did there) with you filling up a few bags of ice at the soda machine.</p><p>Problem: Passing the time. Solution: Because it is finals week, at least being injured forces you to study. Even if I wanted to, I can&rsquo;t run away from my responsibilities.</p><p>Currently, I&rsquo;m balancing on one foot staring out my window. A blanket of snow covers the campus grounds as I watch students struggle against the ice-ridden sidewalks. I am wearing the same sweatpants I put on three days ago. And even though I will be attributing all of my upper body strength to crocheting for the next six weeks, I will stand proudly. (but not actually because I need to sit down and elevate my leg.)</p><p>(Author: Elyse Burandt is a sophomore studying health science from Spokane, Wa.)</p>",soccer-dribbling.jpg,students,0,1481061688
