  Scenario: Content Embed
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "administrator" role
    And article content:
      | title      | moderation_state |
      | My Content | published        |
    And landing_page content:
      | title  | path    | moderation_state |
      | Foobar | /foobar | draft            |
    When I go to "/foobar"
    And I embed the content "My Content" in the "middle" region
    And I click the "li[data-tab-id='save']" element
    And I wait for ajax to finish
    Then the response should contain "My Content"
