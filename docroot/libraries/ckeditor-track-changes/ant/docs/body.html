<h1>Track Changes Plugin for CKEditor</h1>
<h3>based on <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/ice" target="_blank">ICE</a> (NYTimes track changes for <code>contentEditable</code> elements).</h3>
<h2>Main Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Tracks changes from common input sources (keyboard, paste, plugins that modify the document via standard ckeditor api)
<li>Name, Id and time stamp associated with each change
<li>Customizable styles per user
</ul>

<h2>Demo</h2>
<a href="http://www.loopindex.com/lite/demo">Demo Page</a>
<h2>Site</h2>
<a href="http://www.loopindex.com/lite">LoopIndex</a>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<ol><li>Add the LITE plugin to ckeditor. The simplest way to do this is by adding the following line to ckeditor's <code>config.js</code>:
<code>config.extraPlugins = 'lite';</code>
<li>Optionally include <code>lite-interface.js</code> in your source, so you can use the various constants defined in it rather than hard coded strings.
<li>Configure the plugin, either in the ckeditor configuration file, or in code
</ol>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
The LITE plugin is automatically activated after you install it and add it to ckeditor as described above.

<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Changes not applied through keyboard events or the ckeditor api are not tracked 
<li>Some deletion scenarios yield surprising results
</ul>
<h2>Browser Compatibility</h2>
LITE has been tested on Firefox 15+, Chrome 13+ and MSIE 9+. Support for MSIE 8 is not guaranteed.
